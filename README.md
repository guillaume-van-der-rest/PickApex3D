# PickApex3D
Software for analysis of protein mobility data

This software is written in Python 5, and will require that a full install of
Python and PyQt5 is present on the user computer.

Input data should be provided as a CSV File as created by the Driftscope data 
processing software in the Data-Directory/Apex3D subdirectory.

The calibration parameters are those as obtained following the procedure from the 
Ruotolo et al. article (Ruotolo, B.T., Benesch, J.L., Sandercock, A.M., Hyung, S.J., 
Robinson, C.V.: Ion mobility-mass spectrometry analysis of large protein complexes.
Nat Protoc. 3, 1139-1152 (2008)).

Details on the initial program can be found in our initial article :
